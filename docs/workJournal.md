# Medical Solutions of Texas — Work Journal

Running log of build work: what was done, why, and where it landed.
Chronological — newest entry at the bottom. The code says what the site does
now; this says what it used to do and what changing it cost.

The convention is in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) under "The work journal". In
short: every working session appends a dated entry, prose over bullets, why
over what, and history is never edited to be right — a later entry corrects an
earlier one and says so.

## 2026-09-05 — Journal opened, and 181 commits of history summarised rather than reconstructed (`chore/work-journal`)

The journal starts today, so this first entry is a **backfill**: a coarse
summary written from the commit log, not from memory. Detail below this line is
trustworthy; detail above it is not, and nothing here should be cited as though
someone wrote it down at the time. For anything earlier the log is the record —
and a thin one, because most pre-June-2026 subjects are terse (`next`, `ne5xt`,
`manual check`, `changes`). The only contemporaneous prose in the repo is
`docs/UPGRADE_NOTES.md` and `docs/morning-reports/MORNING_REPORT_2026-06-05.md`.

**What this repo is.** The marketing site for Medical Solutions of Texas — a
Veteran-Owned Small Business that helps medical vendors navigate government
healthcare contracting for the DoD and VA — at `medicalsolutionsoftx.com`.
SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5 / Tailwind v4 / Prismic, prerendered onto Netlify.
Forked from the Reddoor wireframer scaffold, whose README was never replaced,
so the file at the repo root describes the starter and not this site.

**The eras.** 181 commits, 2024-10-14 to 2026-09-01, in three unequal years:
68 / 13 / 100.

_2024 (68)._ The build — **47 commits in October alone**: hero video,
preloader, the heartbeat and nav-icon transitions, repeated mobile passes; then
November and December on content and imagery. This is why the pages are bespoke
routes (`about`, `process`, `partners`, `resources`, `contact`) with Prismic
supplying metadata and a single `RichText` slice. The site predates the slice
library it would otherwise have been built from.

_2025 (13)._ Effectively dormant. Client edits arriving one at a time — new
address and phone, fax removed, `gtag`, `robots.txt`, dynamic dates.

_2026 (100)._ Three pushes. **May (15)**: the Svelte 4.2.8 → 5, Vite 5 → 8,
Tailwind 3 → 4, npm → pnpm migration on the `svelte-5` branch —
`docs/UPGRADE_NOTES.md` records it commit by commit and is the thing to read
before touching build config. **June (43)**: fleet onboarding onto
`@reddoorla/maintenance` — shared eslint/prettier/CI/renovate configs, Node 24 +
pnpm 11, Typekit consolidated onto the shared kit `noj4tji`, the contact form
moved off Netlify Forms to central ingest, Turnstile added. **July (19)**:
measurement paying off — homepage payload 37 MB → 3.7 MB, load-aware splash
reveal (SI 5.7s → 4.6s), a Prismic-backed `sitemap.xml`, `/health`, the smoke
suite, and `/rep-login` retired to a 301 rather than deleted in Prismic. August
and September are dependency and CI maintenance.

**State as of this entry.** `main` at `e0bb5f4`, tree clean, nothing in flight.
A dozen stale remote branches survive from merged PRs; none is live work.

**What changed today.** `CLAUDE.md` did not exist here — this repo predates the
convention — so it was created carrying only what the code and log support,
plus "The work journal". And this file exists.
